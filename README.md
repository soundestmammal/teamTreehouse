# teamTreehouse

## As of March 19th, I will begin to re-enforce my progress with the structured curriculum of Team Treehouse.

This is where I will document all of my progress with Team Treehouse. In the past, I would delete the exercises after I was done with them. This was foolish because I have not been able to see track my improvement. By pushing all of my challenges up to GitHub I can not see where I was, where I am, and where I am going.
